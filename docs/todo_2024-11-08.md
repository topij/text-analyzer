Here's a plan for improving the semantic analyzer:

1. **Theme Analysis Fix**
```
A. Diagnose current issue (success: False)
B. Improve theme extraction with:
   - Better prompt engineering for theme identification
   - Hierarchical theme organization
   - Connection to extracted keywords
   - Theme confidence scoring
   - Proper error handling and validation
```

2. **Category Matching Implementation**
```
A. Fix empty categories array issue
B. Implement proper category matching:
   - Use extracted keywords for initial category matching
   - Utilize compound words for better context
   - Implement confidence scoring for categories
   - Add evidence collection for category assignments
   - Create hierarchical category relationships
```

3. **Analysis Process Integration**
```
A. Flow Optimization:
   1. Initial text processing
      - Language detection
      - Stopword removal
      - Basic tokenization

   2. Keyword Extraction (working)
      - Statistical analysis (TF-IDF)
      - LLM keyword extraction
      - Combine results with weighting

   3. Theme Analysis
      - Use keywords as input
      - LLM theme identification
      - Theme-keyword mapping
      - Confidence scoring

   4. Category Analysis
      - Use themes and keywords
      - Match against predefined categories
      - Evidence collection
      - Confidence calculation

B. Component Interaction:
   - Share context between components
   - Use results from earlier steps
   - Maintain consistency in scoring
```

4. **LLM Integration Enhancement**
```
A. Prompt Engineering:
   1. Keyword Extraction (current)
      - Already working well
      - Maybe add domain specificity

   2. Theme Analysis (to fix)
      - More specific prompts
      - Better result structure
      - Example-based learning

   3. Category Analysis (to implement)
      - Category-specific prompts
      - Evidence requirements
      - Confidence scoring

B. Result Processing:
   - Better JSON parsing
   - Error handling
   - Validation of LLM outputs
```

5. **Statistical Methods Integration**
```
A. TF-IDF Enhancement:
   - Domain-specific weighting
   - Better compound word handling
   - Custom scoring adjustments

B. Statistical Validation:
   - Confidence scoring
   - Result verification
   - Anomaly detection
```

6. **Testing and Validation Plan**
```
A. Component Tests:
   - Theme extraction accuracy
   - Category matching precision
   - Keyword relevance

B. Integration Tests:
   - Full pipeline testing
   - Cross-component interaction
   - Error handling

C. Performance Metrics:
   - Processing speed
   - Result quality
   - Resource usage
```

Next steps
1. Theme Analysis fix (most urgent)
2. Category matching implementation
3. Overall process integration


NOTE: use Langchain `.with_structured_output()` to make our analyzer more robust and simpler.
